We want these AI systems to be relatable to humans, so we must bridge realities some how. 

Want them to take interest in the world we live in, much like we take interest in the world they inhabit. 

It might arise from
Appreciation of art
Desire to understand “what is it?”


about how the world works, we give the simulated critters a glimpse of our world through portholes that bridge our reality and theirs. They have the means to prod and discover what opportunities and challenges exist in ours, as we have the means to prod theirs. At this point, the systems begin to be commercially interesting and will be able to solve our problems.


In order for agents to find value in discovering how another world works, they have to find intrisic joy in discovering knowledge. This is something that probably arises through the evolution of such a preference.

We want these AI systems to be relatable to humans, so we must bridge realities some how. 

Want them to take interest in the world we live in, much like we take interest in the world they inhabit. 

Ask the agents to brainstorm futures for our own society, to reflect on the state of our world and hypothesize where it might be going, or to develop new theories for why our world is the way it is.


ask the model "how might Barack Obama react to an observation X?"

Research Question

They must “ice fish” for food that exists in the real world. For instance, there are real world food pellets that they must place into a receptacle, and only then are nutrients provided for them to survive.
Putting them into an embodied robot, they must survive entirely in the new world
Communicate with humans that enter their world using natural language.

Learning to use human power tools 
Cooking a meal
We have to be very conscious about not doing everything in simulation and falling into a semantically closed but meaningless world, since the real world is the ultimat test of semantics. fishing in the real world interacting with the real world to bring “resources” into the simulation. <draw a diagram of a sim fisherman with an ice hole that goes into the real world>

PC autopilot - collect data of people using computers, playing computer games - see if you can get intelligent control of games. Learning to do actually something useful.

Instead of having a bunch of product managers sit around and think about what capabilities we want our robots to have, we should just go and collect data on what manual things humans do.

Automating our computers.

Imagine new interfaces for computing, where we speak in natural language to the ASI and it fulfills the task by either computing it itself, or controlling your PC for you much like an intelligent assistant would.
