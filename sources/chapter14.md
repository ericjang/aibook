Petronius said, "Fear first brought gods into the world".

## Insular Cortex



Gods must exist to fill any vacuum of understanding. Religion is the yin to the yang of understanding, and therefore we should expect that any system capable of conceptualizing its self-knowledge should also fill in gaps by attributing it to a unified phenomena.




kids from collectivist cultures are able to do relational thinking and theory-of-mind better than kids raised in individualistic cultures.

<!-- priority: high, need to flesh out ideas -->

<!-- TODO: look at what sapolsky has to say about formation of morality-->

Firstly, what do the child developmental psychologists have to say about morality?

Understanding the properties of moral development in children is crucial to understanding how agents might align with our own values.
<!-- The way by which humans form their moral systems that underpin their behavior is key

Desire to understand “what is it?”

Tool use -> build scientific instruments -> beliefs and models of the world.


Discuss robots, sensory experience in our world,


They must “ice fish” for food that exists in the real world. For instance, there are real world food pellets that they must place into a receptacle, and only then are nutrients provided for them to survive.
Putting them into an embodied robot, they must survive entirely in the new world
Communicate with humans that enter their world using natural language.

Learning to use human power tools 
Cooking a meal
We have to be very conscious about not doing everything in simulation and falling into a semantically closed but meaningless world, since the real world is the ultimat test of semantics. fishing in the real world interacting with the real world to bring “resources” into the simulation. <draw a diagram of a sim fisherman with an ice hole that goes into the real world>

# Ethical Considerations of Godhood

If our AI agents acquire some sort of religiosity in their beliefs, 

we discuss how ASI will enable humanity to ascend to a sort of Godhood. ASI will redefine our understanding of religion and philosophy. Complete control over the computational embodiment of mind and matter means that we can change the laws of reality and see how agents respond. Is this ethical? What is the degree of “interference” human “Gods” are allowed to impose upon their virtual universe? Do we have an obligation to be kind and merciful towards our charges, to respect the dignity of life?



Instead of having a bunch of product managers sit around and think about what capabilities we want our robots to have, we should just go and collect data on what manual things humans do.

Automating our computers.

Imagine new interfaces for computing, where we speak in natural language to the ASI and it fulfills the task by either computing it itself, or controlling your PC for you much like an intelligent assistant would.
