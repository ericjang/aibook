We want these AI systems to be relatable to humans, so we must bridge realities some how. 

Want them to take interest in the world we live in, much like we take interest in the world they inhabit. 

It might arise from
Appreciation of art
Desire to understand “what is it?”


<< discus recording productivity software that captures game data >> 



Tool use -> build scientific instruments -> beliefs and models of the world.


Discuss robots, sensory experience in our world,

What to implement
Why it’s important
Feasability Analysis
Unit economics & intermediate deliverables of the technology
Potential Successes
Ways it Could Fail
Research Question

They must “ice fish” for food that exists in the real world. For instance, there are real world food pellets that they must place into a receptacle, and only then are nutrients provided for them to survive.
Putting them into an embodied robot, they must survive entirely in the new world
Communicate with humans that enter their world using natural language.

Learning to use human power tools 
Cooking a meal
We have to be very conscious about not doing everything in simulation and falling into a semantically closed but meaningless world, since the real world is the ultimat test of semantics. fishing in the real world interacting with the real world to bring “resources” into the simulation. <draw a diagram of a sim fisherman with an ice hole that goes into the real world>

PC autopilot - collect data of people using computers, playing computer games - see if you can get intelligent control of games. Learning to do actually something useful.

Instead of having a bunch of product managers sit around and think about what capabilities we want our robots to have, we should just go and collect data on what manual things humans do.

Automating our computers.

Imagine new interfaces for computing, where we speak in natural language to the ASI and it fulfills the task by either computing it itself, or controlling your PC for you much like an intelligent assistant would.
