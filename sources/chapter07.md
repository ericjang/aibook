Given that Life’s pursuit of survival is the only process that has created general intelligence to date, it is tempting to suggest that we can achieve AGI by simulating evolution until it produces an organism approaching human-level competency. That is the main approach that I, and many other researchers who came before me, propose we do in order to solve AGI.

It’s a simple idea, but by no means an easy one to execute. Thorny implementation questions arise when one puts their fingers to the proverbial computer terminal. What stuff exactly is doing the “surviving and evolving”? How physically accurate does the simulation need to be? What constitutes a “generation”? What is the boundary that separates the living from the non-living?

We are often taught in school that the “cell” is the most basic unit of life. Anything simpler than a cell - viruses, mitochondria and organic molecules - are not really alive. The usual explanation provided in textbooks is that these things require a host cell to survive and reproduce and perform their function, which disqualifies them from “self-sufficient life”. 

However, this boundary for separating the living and the dead is incomplete - there are some edge cases that break this definition. Viruses need a host cell to survive and replicate, but so do intracellular parasites like Chlamydia (a bacteria). Infertile animals cannot reproduce, and yet are considered very much alive. Reality has a way of challenging our simplistic definitions when we attempt to compress it into simple language.

Evolutionary biology tells us that life comes down to “selfish genes” - information that propagates itself independently of whether it exists in a “living” thing or not. A cell’s job is not actually to survive, but rather to serve as a  protective container for a bundle of genetic information. Much like a sturdy house, the cell handles a certain amount of oxidative abuse and solar radiation from the environment that would otherwise destroy the fragile genetic information inside. Moving up the food chain, multicellular organisms can be regarded as a stronger, more complex container for the same genetic information. These containers can perform more complex survival behaviors, such as specializing their cells to become sensors, actuators, or armor.

A civilization is an even sturdier life-form -- one that protects individuals and their genetic information. But at the end of the day, all of these levels of biological complexity live in service of propagating genetic information. Society, humans, cells - all these are just meat shields.

But if survival is about genetic information, then therein lies a puzzle: if a fish evolves into a man in order to protect its genetic information, who is doing the surviving - the fish or the man? Consider that the genetic code of a species is ever changing, happy to sexually recombine or mutate to achieve better fitness in its environment. Within a species, no two individuals have exactly the same genome. How do we reconcile this fact with the notion that “genetic information tries to survive”? The answer is that the species cooperates to protect shared genetic information.

This principle transcends species: a closed ecosystem (such as our biosphere) performs evolutionary selection of fit individuals, and the continued survival of the most fit species (regardless of bacteria, mammal, or virus) protects the most common genetic denominator: the ability to persist oneself and replicate. Of course, within this “globally cooperative meat shield” there are numerous other shields attempting to preserve more specific kinds of information. A species will compete with other species for resources. An individual cell might go rogue and prioritize its own information over that of the multicellular individual (e.g. carcinogenesis).




Finally, no living organism can truly perform allostasis on their own; most living things depend on a complex web of other participating lifeforms to survive. Without other living things to continue the carbon and nitrogen cycles, life would quickly extinguish itself. Drop any animal onto the surface of Jupiter, and it will be as helpless as a virus sitting by itself in the midday sun.

The language of physics offers us an escape here, allowing us to think about computation and information without ascribing tricky words like “survive, try, want” to them. 



To define and create life without getting tangled in a sticky web of semantics, we must journey to the origin of Life itself, at the threshold when non-living matter first crossed into the realm of the living. We will discuss a few things that are “life-like”.

At the edge of what is alive and dead we have “genetic parasites” - information that replicates itself.Mobile group II self-splicing introns are “selfish genes” that are introns in DNA. DNA polymerase transcribes (intron + host) genome into a mRNA, which then actually execute the behavior of cutting and editing  itself to minimize damage to the original host genome. The resulting mRNA encodes a reverse transcriptance, which takes the RNA back into DNA - including the original paraitstici genes. 

We quickly find ourselves wandering the dangerous philosophical question of “what is life’s purpose?”

the "meaning"/"purpose" of Life, if it exists, cannot be articulated precisely in human language, for language is lossy and can't even describe what sandwiches are. But vaguely speaking, it is to improve the evolutionary success of one's cells, self, family, and species.

Are We Really Ourselves?
what does it mean for something to be alive?
it's related to "are we really ourselves"
consider that many animals behave in ways that are not beneficial for the individual's survival, but rather the propagation of its genetic code
so are we "us", or are we "genetic code" wrapped in a protective meat layer?but 
This is because we do not have the freedom to decide "agency" for things we cannot trivially control with our computers (for instance, we cannot easily assign the molecular structure of the aluminum we use to build a robot).
 
In robotics, people usually go from autonomous differential equations (no input variables, for modeling things like weather or populations)
 
 
 to (non-autonomous) controlled differential equations (you are allowed to set u(t))

111 undergoes some conversion into entropy (waste heat with no thermodynamic potential).

Starting out with physical laws of the universe seems like an odd way to approach biology, but bear with me here. Biology ultimately reduces to complex physics, so we must first understand why our physical universe permits what we call life.


Landauer - thermal irreversibility and computation?

Life and The Second Law of Thermodynamics

Life is made considerably more interesting by the laws of thermodynamics. Life processes emit a massive amount of waste heat (entropy) in order to reduce their internal entropy. This waste heat makes things more difficult. Life is like a video game that gets harder and harder the better you are at it.  The second law of thermodynamics provides a natural “learning curriculum” for life.

Any computer - made of spinning parts or charged transistors or even the cellular ones - involve some degree of heat dissipation that occurs when the computational substrate moves. However, Landauer’s paper “Irreversibility and Heat Generation in the Computing Process” showed that computing any non-invertible function itself generates a small amount of entropy.

This is because computational invertibility is one and the same with respect to time-reversibility in physics! Any time-irreversible phenomena generates entropy, and consequently so does computing any non-invertible function!  

every time you calculate a ReLU in a neural network, you are generating entropy via non-invertible computation and bringing us closer towards the heat death of the universe

We humans perform non-reversible computations all the time (classification), and we use these computations to design even more entropy-exporting systems. Whether its global warming or universe warming, humans simply do not stop
 

The thermodynamics of life:

We can apply this framework of thinking to biology, where organisms are “meat shields” that serve only as long as they need to. An adult mayfly lives for a single day with the sole purpose to reproduce, so it doesn’t even need to eat and has non-functional mouth parts and no intelligence regarding eating. 

It is here that we draw the connection explicitly to biological life: “Intelligent behavior” is nothing more than the flexibility of environments under which a piece of information remains stable. This is what draws the line between life and death. Life begins when an open system begins to perform adaptive behavior in response to its surroundings. This adaptive behavior should also be accompanied by an increase in complexity.

Our genomes work in much the same way. Our genetic code is “protected” by transcribing a cellular wrapper that can regulate internall information to be stable, respond to its environment. More complex organisms can arrange many cells together to form a more hardy system. But regardless of bacteria, mouse, or human being, we are all just “meat shields” for our genetic information.

All life possesses intelligent behavior, even the smallest single-celled organisms can sense the world around them and make decisions that maximize the chances of favorable outcomes.  As organism gets smarter, it can predict the future better, navigate to reduce effect of external entropy on its internal entropy (information).

Note that these do not impose hard requirements on complexity or energy expenditure. It is perfectly valid to have an information system that consumes enormous amounts of energy in order to sustain its configuration to the external world, as it is for a small piece of informatioon that consumes modest or no information in the world. These are all things that are allowable in the universe, and like life, we can expect a great deal of “complexity / energy niches” occupied by information.

Below is a diagram illustrating the various forms of informatioon systems that exist in our universe, as a function of their complexity and stability: 

Many things are simultaneously thriving and changing.

<TODO, figure here>

Information will literally invent cells to shield itself from chaos, and invent multicellular individuals to shield cells, and invent civilizations in order to shield its multicellular individuals. Stable configurations of information - which may have evolved to shield other information - continue to adapt to protect themselves.

But just as gravity eventually pulls all information together, we should expect that any information-consuming information eventually competes with some other information that is also hungry for information. A piece of information may be stable for eons, but eventually it must contend with competing for information with another stable piece of information, or die from the heat death of the universe. Thus a competitive selection for stability is inherent to the dynamics of the universe.

Now that we’ve laid out an abstract framework for how information can be self-preserving, let’s discuss how it played out in our own universe
<!-- draw a connection to Nick Lane’s The Vital Question book here, where he presents a narrative of proton gradients forming ATP, membranes, etc. this provides a concrete implementation, competition, sexual selection, death -->

Sure, it is possible for information to start defending itself against the second law of thermodynamics (and other information attempting to do the same). This much is obvious, as our universe is an existence proof that this is true. 

But self-preserving in it’s early stages must have been very fragile - hardly able to contend with a hostile environment. What allowed a continual envolution? 


An illustration of how under the right conditions, we can build a positive feedback loop where information becomes more complex (more cooperation) and energetically demanding (more competition), and yet more stable. We begin with an abundant source of energy being continuously streamed at a finite rate into an environment (e.g. a hydrothermal vent, or the solar flux onto earth’s surface). (1) A sufficiently stable piece of information will randomly convert into a configuration of information that is more complex and stable. This can be achieved through (2) energy storage, improved motility and energy-seeking, or replication. (3) This kick-starts a positive feedback loop - the increased complexity raises the difficulty for all other information, which leads to a filtering step where information that is not able to compete in its current context are deleted from the universe. (4) if the newly formed information are still stable in the post-selection universe, then the process begins anew. 


If you were to take any individual on earth and teleoport it to the environmental conditions of Jupiter, how smart it is becomes largely irrelevant, and it would quickly perish. So something about Earth’s conditions not only allowed complexity and intelligence.

The question becomes then, under which circumstances and laws of a universe does this not only become possible, but probable? We don’t actually know how probable our own evolutionary history is, given that we would not be around to see it if it didn’t happen. But if we hope to re-create life, we must ensure that the probability is fairly high. 

Once the most primitive of intelligence emerges, under what conditions will the intelligence not only survive, but thrive, and continue to fill all available energy niches with valid solutions.

I think in order for this to work, the environment must be abundant in energy, so that successful information can spread around for a long time without overcrowding. 

Several key steps: 
An important building block to form is the ability to store energy (like ATP). imagine information randomly drifting around, it “dies” when it runs out of energy. Storing encountered excess energy is a great way to preserve information, and creates new complexity (due to the accumulated energy), which then begets more energetic demand.


Movement / navigation -  Information that translates itself through space by converting energy into force. This allows it to actually navigate to sources of energy, position itself to accumulate more energy.


The final step is the phenomenon of “replication” -- information that can duplicate itself, which allows any good accidents to rapidly fill the space with 

In an energy-abundant world, 
Replication is a strong strategy for preserving informatioon because if one copy is destroyed due to happenstance, the other remains. This works even if the copies ignore each other. But what if the copies work together? 
replication is key for providing emergent complexity - a self-replicating informatioon that can “cooperate” with copies of itself can lead to a much more complex system that fundamentally preserves the underlying information being replicated. 

Why does information not simply protect itself forever, like a sort of immortal vampire? Is replication essential? 


The whole system itself may be less stable, but it increases the stability of the underlying.

Heree is the fundamental solution to open-endedness : 

Greater information stability of parts can be achieved when it becomes a whole, whether it be a replica (A → A, A), or symbiosis (A, B → AB). The more stable the whole is, the more stable the parts are.

Information systems competing for energy create further selection pressure. 


Even when energy is abundant (like that of a hydrothermal vent or that of the sun), energy not being uniformly distributed means that there will be inherent competition. 

A piece of information that clones itself will immediately compete with its copy if there is not enough energy in its immediate vicinity to sustain both of them.

There is a fundamental space constraint that they can’t both be in thee same place to harvest the same piece of energy.




Replication is the final piece of the puzzle - it 





Stability can be improved by finding new molecular configurations that are energetically stable. For instance, the transition from RNA → DNA. Some day humans may indeed achieve much longer lifespans by uploading their DNA to a Blue-Ray DVD, and then cloning themselves with that DNA 1000 years into thee future. It won’t achieve immortality for the individual, but it will achieve immortality for their genes.



Kenneth Stanley - Open-Endedness
Evolution keeps on inventing new stuff - open-endedness. Gets more interesting the longer it goes.
Algorithms converge to the solution, they get stuck. 
AlphaGo - the longer you train it the better it gets.
Strong open-endedness - go forever. The longer you simulate it, the better it gets.

The world is full of stuff, 
The vast majority of objects exist in “stable” configurations. The combination of high energetic demand and high stability implies that it must be able to seek out energy dispersed in the universe in order to maintain its equilibrium state.

Interestingly, nearly all genetic information of life foron earth has more or less the same lifespan, up to a constant multiplicative factor. This is a crucial hint that life’s goal is not to optimize for intelligence, but rather that there are many ecological niches and pockets of energy, each of which requires new designs and intelligent behavior to exploit that resource.


Life does not distinguish between body and computation. Organisms without nervous systems are capable of intelligent behavior.

In multicellular life, the welfare of cells are often sacrificed to ensure the survival of the individual, and the welfare of the individual is often sacrificed to ensure the survival of the species. Thus, the “stuff” doing the surviving is actually the information - the specific A-C-G-T base pair sequences that transcribe raw materials into living, running cells that continue that sequence.  

Drill down even further - realize that all life shares the same ribosomes, so you could argue that all life - any organism - is just ribosomes making more ribosomes.

what happens when genetic information itself changes? A species can survive for billions of years, but its genome mutates and forks over time, accumulating small changes across the members of its population. Genetic information is perfectly happy to mutate into a “different” set of information if it means that the resulting cells, individuals, and societies are able to handle whatever the universe throws at it better. 

Consider a far-distant future, billions of years from now, where the descendents of today’s genetic information have gradually changed to use an entirely different set of replication mechanisms (perhaps even abandoning ribosomes and carbon-based DNA altogether). 

We won’t be able to compare such genetic information in the “code-space” of base pairs - because these life-forms might not even have ACGT base pairs, but there will still be retained “mutual information” - a certain degree of overlap in the fundamental function of the two systems. Remember that information and computation are substrate independent! 

Such information will invariably still be able to protect itself against whatever the universe throws at it (otherwise it would cease to exist). Because there is some overlap in capability (despite the difference in substrate and form), we can say that there is shared information. Even if DNA-based life ceases to exist, the mutual information representing “persistence” will continue until the universe becomes too hostile for any information to stick around.

Humans have already begun to migrate information that helps us survive into cultural mediums, like storing our history in oral tradition and bits inside external hard drives. Is our oral history and culture said to be “alive”? I argue that yes, great intelligence is devoted to preserving that history against the chaos of the universe.  and a series of robots simply continue the oral tradition of humanity to each other while replicating robots. 

A stable crystal is stable insofar as it is able to deal with a minor amount of energy added to the system without collapsing, much like a house is able to deal with a certain amount of wind and elements. But it does not consume energy, so despite its stability. 

In fact, before DNA was discovered, Erwin Schrodigner hypothesized the existence of genetic information implemented via the substrate of an aperiodic crystalline structure in the talk What is Life lecture, given in 1943.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/What_Is_Life%3F

The Pyramids of Giza are “alive” insofar as they immortalize their creators and compel modern humans to tend to their preservation (as a cultural monument).


If we accept that information is independent of substrate, and I inscribe the human genome on a rock that will outlast the last living human by several millennia, is the inscription also “alive”?


# Cooperation and Competition: An Information-Theoretic View

What is "social behavior"? It's a vague, general concept as nebulous as the definition of life itself, so let's turn to an abstract, information-theoretic definition. Recall from [chapter 7](chapter07.html) that we defined life as "self-replicating physical information". Physical information can be manifested in the cells within individuals, the shared genome of a group of individuals, or even the seasonal patterns within the weather. Through this lens, “social cooperation” can be viewed as two pieces of information that reinforce each other’s existence through their own interaction with the world. 

Concrete examples of this can be two symbiotes: a tube worm provides shelter and a stable environment for bacteria, which in turn synthesize inorganic sulfur and carbon into food for the worm. Two humans who agree to trade goods also improve their own survival, especially if they specialize to do what is more efficient for either. Specialization and cooperation together form a strong driving force in evolution, not only in evolution but also in reference to basic evolutionary changes in animals like Williston's law. 

Even things that look like competition at first glance - two creatures competing for a scarce resource, are more complex than they seem. From an information-theoretic standpoint, competition and cooperation are actually inseparable - they are sides of the same coin, yin to yang. Imagine two dogs fighting over a mate or another scarce resource. Competition arises between the fragments of identity (genomic or otherwise) that differ between the two dogs. But another way to look at the fight is that two copies of shared genes - the common genetic information between the two individuals - are working together to select the stronger traits in the genome and prune out the weaker ones. The dog's mitochondrial genome does not care which dog wins, all it knows is that two of its "copies" are cooperating (via a contest of strength) to keep their genes strong. There are long-running contests that ensure the overall survivability of life, and with it the basic building blocks that all life share - things like ribosomes, viruses, mitochondria.

Conversely, when two pieces of genetic information combine via sexual reproduction, the resulting set of offspring are a random combination of their differences. The process of meiosis, by which a diploid chromosome fragments into smaller pieces - paradoxically ensures better survival of the fragments by re-combining with the other parent's genes, than if all the fragments were grouped together into a single organism that had to clone itself over and over. In some way, it is as if each chromosome in the parent is independently striving to preserve itself, regardless of whether it is expressed with the other chromosomes in the parent cell.


Life is like a fractal - as you zoom in, you see many forms of genetic information, always trying to preserve itself across time.
