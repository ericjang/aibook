I have always been envious of the high-tech, futuristic interfaces shown in iron man - nary a keyboard in sight, all computations done at a high level, with natural language conversing with the human user. 

Our future of interacting with AI will change the interface between man and machine. Right now we use keyboard, screen, and mouse.

In the future, we might not need screens anymore, rather we just converse naturally with a simple .

For example, AirBnb currently hires hundreds of engineers to build the frontend for its booking experience. But imagine a different user flow, where you’re simply chatting with a travel agent who shows you photos of the place you’ll be staying, the sights to see. 

what if in the future, the interface could be simplified to something as simple as planning a trip with a friend over

When booking a trip, 

There’s no need to have a beautiful AirBnb website, the agent just books what we like.

Computation is a form of work

visual, flow-based programming is an intuitively appealing design for people who don't want to learn the syntax of programming languages, but at the same time has failed to achieve mainstream use because it's difficult to scale them to complex ideas. For instance, expressing for loops, meta-programming (using programs the write programs), and cyclic dependencies in a multi-process system is challenging. perhaps natural language and vision models can be a "intuition compiler" that translates our napkin sketches into working systems.

## Risks

One possible risk is that humans become dependent on AI systems to interact with their access to information, and
