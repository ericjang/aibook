<!-- TODO: make this section "how to deploy AI in businesses" -->

There are two kinds of AI businesses:

- ones that replace an existing process in business pipeline with a self-contained thing. This kind of business succeeds by talking to customers, iterating on customer feedback, and building something that customers want.

- ones that re-design the entire value chain to the customer for a product that wasn't possible before. There isn't any process it is a drop-in replacement for, it is the first of its kind. 

OpenAI + Github copilot might be an example

Rethinking Publishing


Holocrons - instead of reading a book for knowledge, you converse with a simulacrum of the author, and engage in debates.


- increasingly large pie for data labeling and data management
- for label propagation to help with triaging vast amounts of data, coupled with anomaly detection software that flags if one cluster of data looks unlike another.
- ML securiy machine learning securty - find holes / analyze public company's ML offering , understand what their model might be doing, look for potential PR disasters 




AI technology will trickle its way down to content creation, for video editors who take a video of a neat object and have that object be automatcally transferred into a simulation, complete with articulation.



I have always been envious of the high-tech, futuristic interfaces shown in iron man - nary a keyboard in sight, all computations done at a high level, with natural language conversing with the human user. 

Our future of interacting with AI will change the interface between man and machine. Right now we use keyboard, screen, and mouse.

In the future, we might not need screens anymore, rather we just converse naturally with a simple .

For example, AirBnb currently hires hundreds of engineers to build the frontend for its booking experience. But imagine a different user flow, where you’re simply chatting with a travel agent who shows you photos of the place you’ll be staying, the sights to see. 

what if in the future, the interface could be simplified to something as simple as planning a trip with a friend over

When booking a trip, 

There’s no need to have a beautiful AirBnb website, the agent just books what we like.

Computation is a form of work

visual, flow-based programming is an intuitively appealing design for people who don't want to learn the syntax of programming languages, but at the same time has failed to achieve mainstream use because it's difficult to scale them to complex ideas. For instance, expressing for loops, meta-programming (using programs the write programs), and cyclic dependencies in a multi-process system is challenging. perhaps natural language and vision models can be a "intuition compiler" that translates our napkin sketches into working systems.

## Risks

One possible risk is that humans become dependent on AI systems to interact with their access to information, and
