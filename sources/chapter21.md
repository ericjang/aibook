Many AI researchers are anti-war. 

Many of my colleagues find the idea of discussing ML technology in war revolting, to the poin

I think this is dangerous because it leads to a reductive understanding of the technology - 

in progressive circles we endlessly point to how AI technology can reinforce social inequalities, and execute brown people in the middle east conflicts.

It's easy to be anti-war in times of peace, when your home country looks like a colonizer subjugating less powerful countries.

But what if a foreign power is flexing its muscles, doing things that don't align with your basic moral values that transcend citizenship?



For instance, mass surveillance of citizenships is objectionable.


## Latency War

A General Atomics MQ-9 Reaper drone, often deployed by the united states and her friends to rain death upon their enemies, has a round-trip communication latency of 2.4 seconds. This is the time it takes for an image to be transmitted, sent over satellite to a military base, for a pilot to make a decision, and then for the command to return to the drone. 

This means that in the future, where everyone has a drone made by USA or Turkey or China, wars are fought and won in the span of about 2.4 seconds.

I studied quite a bit of remote teleoperation of Mobile Manipulators at Google and can tell you that the latency of about 200 milliseconds means a whole world of difference. 

Obviously, whoever is physiically closer to the drone they are piloting will have shorter latencies, and be able to react much faster.
