<chapter: talk about play and childlike behavior and animal play?>

Jungle Basketball - play behavior when agents are younger.


Cuddly by experience and asssociation.

A hammer does not exist to a dog - it has no significance because dogs dont act on it or use them. But if a human uses it, the object now has meaning to a dog.
Babies don’t understand that which is irrelevant. 
Relying primarily on smell conveys a very different understanding of “the present” than what humans do - humans rely mostly on vision, letting them see a single instant in time. In any moment, dogs will smell a lingering trace of what we perceive as the past, and an oncoming whiff of what humans perceive as “the future”.

“including not just the scene currently happening, but also a snatch of the just-happened and the up-ahead. The present has a shadow of the past and a ring of the future about it.”

 we will attempt to create dogs by domesticating wolves, just as our human ancestors did eons ago. Rather than embody agents in our world, it is simpler to send humans into their world using VR. We can have virtual canines interact with real humans through a VR interface, pet them, cuddle them, and so on. Through this process, we try to make the AI useful and socially aware of real humans by designing virtual pets.

Implementing Shyness

Shyness in animals is an evolutionary adaptation where unfamiliar agents are likely to be harmful / or a predator, so the animal learns to treat it with apprehension.


Dogs have the ability to engage in play 

That solving “Interpretability” depends on an implicit understanding of human language and human thought, i.e. our own imperfect rationalizations for how things are the way they are.
For that reason, we may need to build a human mind before we can reliably communicate with one. A dog is a first step towards that, a “slightly less ambitious” goal.
The secret to all this is imperfection [sic]. Things like wrinkles, less-than-perfect teeth, details  like fading scars [sic] look at my nose, see my nose? See, it’s bulbous and slightly irregular? Well, I’m the only one that’s got my nose and that makes me me.

Domestication

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Origin_of_the_domestic_dog

Domestication of the dog  (36,000 - 14200 years ago) predates agriculture (11,000) - wild populations of aurochs, boar, sheep, goats.

Humans Sharing excess meat with wolves - a form of synergy where a multi-agent system is able to extract more nutrients from the environment than either of the two alone.

Shybot - robot that avoids human contact and makes an effort to do so will add richness to the environment (so long as it is also able to survive, of course).

Inside 

Beginnings of the digitization of people in VR>

What to implement
A way for humans to provide supervision behavior and interact with agents by teleoperating human agents.
Why it’s important


Feasability Analysis
VR 
Unit economics & intermediate deliverables of the technology
Build household environments in simulation, If you want to build a household robot, try to build an Apex Predator like a bear first, and then give it a mild case of OCD


Intermediate deliverable: ML middleware for VR 

Life uses just enough intelligence to handle the environment and for its duration of lifespan. A dog lives 10-13 years. 

Imagine simulating the lifespan of an animal for 13 years ! we simply don’t have the computational resources to optimize a system to behave for 13 years. The other strategy is to increase the difficulty

Dog has to be able to do tricks (stick nose in hole formed by two hands)

Given a world governed by finite, non-randomly distributed energy, and energy taking on many forms, life/death provides endless source of evolutionary signal, given a sufficiently rich and large environment.


Energy in the world is finite and not randomly distributed across space



Thematically, the book will revisit similar ideas:
Semantics are hard, and putting together semantic systems into a whole that doesn’t break at the seams is harder still. life/death objective with the two principles
The importance of empiricism - truth can only be uncovered by testing your knowledge on reality itself. This principle will extend from what algorithms we deploy to how we do research.
An AGI must learn from a considerable amount of data capturing what it means to be human. This will require collecting data from AI interacting with humans.


social attachment to people (VR dog, behavior cloning). 
discusses VR as a method of collecting human data and what we hope to learn from it. It is important to have artificial beings interact with humans as part of their learning process. Not only as a way of ethical alignment, but more importantly as a method of data collection - absorbing the data of humans motions and sounds. It will be easier to build a world in VR than deal with the complexities and difficulty of achievihng scinetiifc reproducibility in real world robots. This is built in parallel to chapter 6, clone pets in VR. fine-tuning survival machines into something that likes people. Vets the idea of building an apex predator and then fine tuning it to be likeable to humans. VR because real robots are hard.


Dogs and cats like to sit in boxes, curl up in toilet bowls, snuggle up to their favorite toy and squirm into your lap.
What is the drive for “coziness” that gives pets that adorable behavior?
Desire to be protected, feeling of safety (that only arises if you live in a world with dangerous things!)
Evolve this by having objects / shelters that protect animals from the elements (cold) and other animals (being eaten)

Conversation with Andrej Karpathy - learn a wolf, and then fine-tune it into a Golden Retriever.

Cuddling behavior
Motivation to feel comfortable
Motivation to have a contact with the object of attachment

Do the same, but in reverse - Harry Potter Living Portraits - imbue paintings with animation. 


Dogs as RL machines: they can 

Once we have a general-purpose RL agent that can quickly seek out rewards (food) given its master’s feedback, then we can re-purpose dogs to do all sorts of things - label data, detect spam. 

Can we build a dog without its sense of smell? To what extent is a dog’s behavior a function of what inputs it has access to? 

Mini Games

A completely open-ended objective can result in a bit of stagnation - the system is so open-ended that people lose a sense of competitiveness.


Have you ever observed how children will invent games out of seemingly ordinary household items? 

“In a living room: The floor is lava, but the sofa cushions are okay, let’s see who falls into the lava first”
“On a play structure: ” 

Even animals will “play” games with each other and humans, devising little contests of strength (tug of war), speed (who can retrieve the stick first)


We can devise a number of ad-hoc contests, presented to the agents like “first agent to collect N apples wins, the floor is lava, don’t touch it”.


Evidence of animals doing play: 
https://greatergood.berkeley.edu/article/item/games_animals_play#:~:text=Most%20animals%20have%20been%20observed,%2C%20physical%2C%20and%20psychological%20skills.


Another is to make the game competitive with respect to skill - Valorant players compete and motivate themselves to get better because it feels good to win, and there are ranking systems that give people dopamine when they level up.

<TODO - study gamification>


Summary:
Technical goal: Capturing the notion of “friendliness” / the affection of dogs into software
