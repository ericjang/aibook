<!-- ground the reader in the evolved neurobehavior system of animals, so as we read about new ideas in RL, we can remind ourselves on what level of behavior we are seeing

Yann Lecun , Ishan Misra - "common sense is dark matter of intelligence"

they believe that self-supervision at the data level, i.e. looking at pixels together, is the way.

those are nice representation learning algorithms, but they use a lot of human knowledge / inductive biases / deep learning optimization tricks to help learn the common sense aspect.

but we must go further - capture data from the processes that shape those common sense mechanisms themselves.
