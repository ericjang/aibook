*"The highest and most beautiful things in life are not to be heard about, nor read about, nor seen but, if one will, are to be lived."*
*- Soren Kierkegaard*

An agent that plays jungle basketball would have no need to create art - it doesn’t win the game, why would it ever need this?  

An agent might build a pile of rocks, a stack of three with a large flat rock, a medium-sided rock in the middle, and a small pebble on top to signal to its teammate an important landmark, or strategically important spot. Other agents may begin to ascribe semantic significance to particular arrangements of rocks. 

We need to have an environment rich enough to let agents assemble objects into primitive art pieces, or mark the environment in ways that serve purposes of communication, memory. 



Art might serve as visual aides for remembering important stories / lessons, which in turn are  crucial for passing on cultural lessons  / war strategy
Art might be used to stimulate entertainment centres of brain / aesthetic appreciation originally evolved for appraising reproductive fitness and health


Over time, in more complex organisms like humans, art itself signals intelligence and creativity, itself a sign of reproductive fitness


What would it take for an agent in Jungle Basketball to want to create art?


Our appappreciation of art also comes from our fascination with stories and narratives - even when we are presented a work of art without its context, our mind inpaints impressions of the scene, what it represents.

So our AI systems will also need to have an appreciation of narrative


Competitive Housekeeping - game where agents compete to maintain configuration of environment. The “slob” tries to take out objects and use them,  

And the “tidy” tries to put objects back into their right places. 


i don't think i could ever write a rap song feigning that level of confidence

it makes me wonder how our own egos and moral sensibilities constrain us from thinking certain ideas

There’s just some ideas that are so offensive that most people would just not want to spend the hours making it. 


Just as intelligent behavior signals sexual selection, certain forms of artistic creation signal intelligence or capability.

Art cannot be understood / appreciated without the context of being an animal or the underlying intelligence it signals.

AI generated art

These are undoubtedly beautiful, but each one of these has an identical story - a neural net crunches a random number for about 100 milliseconds, and out comes an image.

the first ones do have the meaning - the implications of ai-generated art, or the human effort that went into building the method
it's almost because i know that it was cheaply printed that i discount its value

Instead of synthesizing an image, we must create the artist, something with a unique history that can be understood from a human lens - struggle, happiness, sadness, desire. 

Where does our appreciation of beauty come from?

Symmetry, lack of deformity → healthy, nutritious, good mating potential. Or safe situations tend to be more symmetrical, because perhaps there wasn’t some disturbance. 

Or perhaps rarity - we notice that which is scarce / unique / novel, and pride owning it (think an abalone-encrusted decorated knife)

Would the simulation even permit creating an encrusted knife?



I want to buy art that was challenging to make, took effort, not one that can be printed en masse.




An ASI cannot write a brilliant work of detective & murder mystery without living in a world where it is possible to conceptualize such a thing.



Appreciating beauty.
